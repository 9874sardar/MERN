Multer - Multer in Node.js is a middleware that is used for the easy handling of multipart/form data that is used when file uploading is done. To get maximum efficiency, Multer has been built on the top of a busboy, a node.js module that is used to handle incoming HTML form data in requests. Multer is similar to the body parser in Node.js (an express middleware) in functionality, but it only supports the multipart data.

Formidable - Whenever we submit a form on the client-side of any website, all the form data goes to the server-side. Usually, form-data gets encoded before we submit it to the server. We can do this by specifying the enctype attribute in the <form> tag in HTML.
